# Project Proposal #

## Game Concept: ##

The concept of our game is to produce a basic-level Mobile Online Battle Arena. This game will be very similar to League of Legends and DOTA-type games. The user will be given a hero and get to select different abilities. He will begin the game on one corner of the square map and have to fight his way down a lane to the opposite corner. He will face towers that attack him as well as a timed wave of enemies. Once he defeats the opponentâ€™s last tower the game will be over. This game will incorporate:

**Scoring**

> o	Minion take downs will add 10 points to your score

> o	Tower take downs will add 200 points to your score

> o	Time taken will deduct 10 points per minute after 20 minutes elapsed.

> o	Deaths will deduct 100 points from your score

**Levels**

> o	Your hero will level up as he takes down enemies and towers thereby increasing his    skillset and abilities.

> o	The game will have three level settings which the user defines before each game which control the strength of the enemy towers and minions you will face.

**Installation**

> o	This game will be entirely autonomous

**Screen Resolutions**

> o	The 80% version will have a preset resolution of 800x600

**Cheat Mode**

> o	Hero is invulnerable to any damage.

> o	One hit kills anything.

> o Abilities have no cooldowns

**Help Screen**

> o	Upon startup we will display instructions for how to play the game.

**Design**

> o	We will use inheritance and object oriented design as well as the Singleton Pattern when constructing our world environment and variables.
