When I consider how my time is spent

Ere half my days in semester wide

And that one talent, which I"m told I hide

Lodged with me useless--for my mind"s more bent

To sleep. But I have speeches to present,

And papers and programs that I have tried

To write. So work I lest my conscience chide...

Jonathan is a creative writing major, who in a fit of insanity decided to take a couple of computer science classes. This is normal for creative writing majors. The fit of insanity bit, not the computer science classes.

Jon's role in this little project is to coordinate and code things on clientside. This generally involves getting half of his work replaced by code gremlins when he isn't looking.

Jon one day hopes to catch a code gremlin in hopes to interview it to find out why they change his code. Granted the code is usually better... but still!

Unfortunately, Jon has yet to see a code gremlin.
