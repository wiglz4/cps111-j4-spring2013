# Game Objectives #
> Your mission—should you choose to accept it—is to destroy the core on the other end of that little dirt path. But beware! Those pesky towers will be trying to destroy you before you destroy it. And there may be other players on the other team may be trying to destroy _your_ core.

> But fear not! You have a host, a veritable horde, of mechanical minions on a mission—a mission to destroy once and for all all enemies of the Team! Unfortunately the enemy team has minions, too. Bummer.

> So it's up to one person: you. Only you can stop tower fires and wanton core destruction. Or cause it. One or the other. Or both.
